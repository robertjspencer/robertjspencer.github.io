## CMYHE302 - 'Health in the Digital Era' - Long Covid Analysis Project

(Work in progress)

As of 16/05/2022, I am currently in the process of doing an analysis of collected long COVID Facebook posts, from relevant Facebook groups for the course [CMYHE302 - 'Health in the Digital Era'](https://papers.waikato.ac.nz/papers/2022/CMYHE302), as mentioned in my introduction.
