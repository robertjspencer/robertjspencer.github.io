## Project #1. Analyzing 2022 COVID-19 data in the United States

For my first project using SQL I decided to look at publicly available COVID-19 data. [Here](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) is a link to the public dataset I used, provided by The New York Times (NYT).

I'm most interested in the [us-counties-2022.csv](https://github.com/robertjspencer/robertjspencer.github.io/files/8748023/us-counties-2022.csv) file seen above, which contains the columns: date, state, fips, cases and deaths so far this year. Note: Fips is NULL if a county actually reports multiple counties. E.g New York City compromises New York, Kings, Queens, Bronx and Richmond Counties and has a NULL fips value.

To accomodate for us-counties-2022.csv in PostgreSQL, I created the table us_countries_2022 using the query below. I ommitted using constraints as I'm unable to see the need for them in this case. With this table made I then imported us-counties-2022.csv into us_countries_2022
```
CREATE TABLE us_counties_2022(
    date DATE,
    county VARCHAR(50),
    state VARCHAR(50),
    fips INTEGER,
    cases INTEGER,
    deaths INTEGER
);
```

## With this data I plan on answering these questions for my first project:
1. What are the top 10 counties by total cases?
2. What are the top 10 states by total cases?
3. Which 10 counties have the highest deaths:cases ratio?
4. Which 10 states has the highest deaths:cases ratio?
5. What are the top 10 states by deaths:population ratio and is their governor a Democrat or Republican?

### Question 1 answer - What are the top 10 counties by total cases?
Here is the query I used:
```
SELECT county,fips,MAX(cases) AS total_cases FROM us_counties_2022
GROUP BY county,fips
ORDER BY MAX(cases) DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here is the result:

What if I didn't want to include counties that actually compromise of several counties? Here is the query I would use instead:
```
SELECT county,fips,MAX(cases) AS total_cases FROM us_counties_2022
WHERE fips IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY county,fips
ORDER BY MAX(cases) DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Resulting in this:

### Question 2 answer - What are the top 10 states by total cases?
Here is the query I used:
```
SELECT state,MAX(cases) AS total_cases FROM us_counties_2022
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY MAX(cases) DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here is the result:

### Question 3 answer - Which 10 counties have the highest deaths:cases ratio?
Here is the query I used:
```
SELECT  county,
        MAX(deaths) AS total_deaths,
        MAX(cases) AS total_cases,
        ROUND((MAX(deaths) * 1.0 / MAX(cases) * 1.0),4) AS deaths_cases_ratio
FROM us_counties_2022
WHERE deaths IS NOT NULL AND cases IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY county
ORDER BY deaths_cases_ratio DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
The line 'WHERE deaths IS NOT NULL AND cases IS NOT NULL' is necessary here. Without it all of the 10 death:cases ratio results will return the NULL value.

Here is the result:

### Question 4 answer - Which 10 states has the highest deaths:cases ratio?
Here is the query I used:
```
SELECT  state,
        MAX(deaths) AS total_deaths,
        MAX(cases) AS total_cases,
        ROUND((MAX(deaths) * 1.0 / MAX(cases) * 1.0),4) AS deaths_cases_ratio
FROM us_counties_2022
WHERE state != 'Puerto Rico'
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY deaths_cases_ratio DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
'WHERE state != 'Puerto Rico'' is necessary as Puerto Rico is a terrority and will be included in the results without it.

Here is the result:

### Question 5 answer - What are the top 10 states by deaths:population ratio and is their governor a Democrat or Republican?
To answer this question I needed to know each states population, governor and political party which the NYT dataset doesn't contain. So I made a table in Excel with the relevant data myself as seen below. [Here is a link to the file - state_info.csv](https://github.com/robertjspencer/robertjspencer.github.io/files/8747916/state_info.csv).

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105367716/169659390-90b0abdf-03f9-4ee8-9383-63f8f3056924.png)
##### The population data was [retrieved from the United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2020s-state-total.html#par_textimage). The population data used was the 2021 population estimate.

I then created a table using the query below:
```
CREATE TABLE state_info(
    state VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    population INTEGER,
    governor VARCHAR(50),
    political_party VARCHAR(20)
)
```
And then imported state_info.csv into this table. Now I have all the data I need to answer my question.

Lastly here is the query I used to answer this question:
```
SELECT  state_info.state,
        MAX(deaths) AS total_deaths,
        population AS est_population_2021,
        ROUND((MAX(deaths) * 1.0 / population),4) AS deaths_population_ratio,
        governor,
        political_party
FROM state_info
INNER JOIN us_counties_2022
ON state_info.state = us_counties_2022.state
GROUP BY state_info.state
ORDER BY deaths_population_ratio DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Here is the result:

Anyhow there's my first project for now, thanks for reading.
