## CMYHE201 - 'Healthy Lifestyles and Healthy Communities' - Health Promotion Campaign Project

For CMYHE201 - 'Healthy Lifestyles and Healthy Communities', which I took B trimester 2021, we had to group with a partner and design and create a health promotion campaign. 

My partner, Precious Brown, and I's chosen health promotion campaign topic was Asian elderly's high suicide rates here in Aotearoa.

Here is a YouTube video of the presentation: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHcI2pF7-Rw](url). We received an A+ for this presentation.
