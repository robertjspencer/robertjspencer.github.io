## Project #2. July 2022 FIDE Chess Rankings

Towards the start of this year I began to play chess. Whilst I'm no good at it, often losing due to my own mistakes, I've became quite passionate towards the game and its and intricacies. In turn I figured that chess would make for a good topic to analyze, and so for this project I'll be analyzing the FIDE Chess Rankings for July 2022.
