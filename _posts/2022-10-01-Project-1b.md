# Project #1b. A deeper look

In my [previous post](https://robertjspencer.github.io/2022/05/21/COVID19-NYT.html), I looked at COVID-19 data provided by The New York Times. If you haven't read it, I highly recommend reading it before continuing any further.

For my last question for that post, I asked, 'What are the top 10 states by deaths:population ratio and is their governor a Democrat or Republican?' and the results were surprising. Here were the results:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105367716/170274486-64b0e227-ec20-4c59-99ad-1b6e2d3df5c7.png)

As seen above, 9 out of the top 10 states by death:population ratio were Democrat governed sates. 

This was surprising due to how Republicans have questionably handled the pandemic since it began including the promotion of misinformation [[1]](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-misinformation.html)[[2]](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/11/trumps-lies-about-coronavirus/608647/)[[3]](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/gop-state-lawmakers-spread-covid-19-misinformation-76166298)[[4]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/09/14/florida-desantis-vaccine-misinformation-rna/), purposeful ignorance of health and medical professionals [[5]](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03035-4)[[6]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/coronavirus-ravaged-florida-as-ron-desantis-sidelined-scientists-and-followed-trump/2020/07/25/0b8008da-c648-11ea-b037-f9711f89ee46_story.html), disregard for and sometimes outright banning public health measures [[7]](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/06/texas-greg-abbott-covid-restrictions/)[[8]](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgia-governor-brian-kemp-bans-city-face-mask-orders-coronavirus-pandemic/)[[9]](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/appeals-court-rules-favor-florida-governor-reinstates-ban-mask-mandates-florida-2021-09-10/), and the prioritizement of the economy over peoples wellbeing [[10]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886921002658). So this leaves one to ask, if who's in charge doesn't affect a state's deaths:population ratio, what might?

## After some thought as to what might factors might signifanctly affect the deaths:population ratio, I've decided to ask these questions:
1. Does a state's population density correlate with its deaths:population ratio?
2. Does a state's income inequality correlate with its deaths:population ratio?
3. Does a state's education level correlate with its deaths:population ratio?
4. Do the aforementioned indepedent variables combined correlate with a state's death:population ratio?
5. Overall what are my thoughts?

In order to answer the questions above, I collected each state's death:population ratio, population density (population/sq. km.), income inequality [(Gini coefficient)](https://data.oecd.org/inequality/income-inequality.htm) and educational attainment level rates. 

Here is the SQL query I used to collect each states death:population ratio from the 'covid19NYT' database used in Project #1:
```
SELECT  state_info.state,
        MAX(deaths) AS total_deaths,
        population AS est_population_2021,
        (MAX(deaths) * 1.0 / population) AS deaths_population_ratio,
        governor,
        political_party
FROM state_info
INNER JOIN us_counties_2022
ON state_info.state = us_counties_2022.state
GROUP BY state_info.state
ORDER BY state;
```

[Here is a link to the file containing all the aforementioned data - state_info2.xlsx](https://github.com/robertjspencer/robertjspencer.github.io/files/8893161/state_info2.xlsx).

##### The population data was [retrieved from the United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2020s-state-total.html#par_textimage). The population data used was the 2021 population estimate. 
##### The area data was [retrieved from the United States Census Bereau](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/2010/geo/state-area.html). The area data used was Land Sq. Km. 
##### The Gini coefficient data was [retrieved from the United States Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=Gini&g=0100000US_0400000US01,02,04,05,06,08,09,10,11,12,13,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,53,54,55,56,72&tid=ACSDT1Y2019.B19083&moe=false&tp=true).
##### The educational attainment level data was [retrieved from the United States Census Bureau](https://web.archive.org/web/20210427151001if_/https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=educational%20attainment&g=0100000US,.04000.001_0400000US72&tid=ACSST1Y2019.S1501&tp=true&hidePreview=true).


### Question 1 answer - Does a state's population density(X1) correlate with its deaths:population ratio(Y)?

Using state_info2.csv, I calculated the relationship between each state's deaths:population ratio and population density:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105367716/173812038-437dd491-ad4b-487b-b218-33b1af261ed6.png)

The resulting R-value = 0.24. Meaning that there is a weak positive correlation between a state's death:population ratio and population density. 
P = 0.1, as such I am 90% confident about my result.

### Question 2 answer - Does a state's income inequality (X2) correlate with its deaths:population ratio(Y)?

Using state_info2.csv, I calculated the relationship between each state's death:population ratio and income inequality:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105367716/173812428-13076ca2-aa2a-4473-924d-27e1f8ac64ea.png)

The resulting R-value = 0.17. Meaning that there is a weak positive correlation between a state's death:population ratio and income inequality.
P = 0.25, as such I am 75% confident about my result. 

### Question 3 answer - Does a state's education level (X3,X4,X5) correlate with its deaths:population ratio(Y)?

Using state_info2.csv, I calculated the relationship between each state's death:population ratio and education level:

*High school diploma or higher(X3):*
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105367716/173812840-a24d3a3b-72ee-464d-bd68-4101861f217a.png)

The resulting R-value = -0.23. Meaning that there is a weak inverse correlation between a state's educational attainment being 'High school diploma or higher' and death:population ratio.
P = 0.11, as such I am 89% confident about my result.

*Bachelor's degree or higher(X4):*
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105367716/173813246-fa7f95c0-a24d-419f-9ab1-51574b2e53bf.png)

The resulting R-value = 0.0025. Meaning that there is a negligible positive correlation between a state's educational attainment being 'Bachelor's degree or higher' and death:population ratio.
P = 0.99, as such I am 1% confident about my result.

*Advanced degree^(X5):*
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105367716/173813564-b2f8333b-9e50-4ee9-a1b9-72d359a47004.png)
^Advanced e.g. PgCert, PgDip, Hons, Masters, PhD

The resulting R-value = 0.07. Meaning that there is a negligible positive correlation between a state's educational attainment being 'Bachelor's degree or higher' and death:population ratio.
P = 0.62, as such I am 38% confident about my result.

### Question 4 answer - Can any of the aforementioned indepedent variables combined predict a state's death:population ratio?

To answer this question I first used excel to run a simple linear regression between the independent variables I've decided to use, X1 and X3. I've excluded the rest either due to a weak correlation or low confidence level. I've decided to use a 80% confidence level given the low number of observations, as well as due to the fact that a high confidence interval % arguably isn't as important for this situation, unlike for example a clinical study  where even a 95% confidence interval is subpar.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105367716/173878149-7c2f2c95-0f1e-4e34-a760-bc8a9dc374ce.png)

R-value = ±0.08. This is a negligible correlation between X1 and X3 and it's safe to say multicollinearity likely isn't an issue.

Now after having checked for severe multicollinearity, here is the multiple linear regression I ran between Y, X1 and X3:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105367716/173878563-c7cb501d-3095-4de6-9e8a-8431a9b78c71.png)

R-value = ±0.31. This is a weak correlation. R-squared = 0.1, meaning that 10% of the variance of Y is explained by X1 and X3.
