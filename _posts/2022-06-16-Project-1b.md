# Project #1b. A deeper look

[In one of my previous posts](https://robertjspencer.github.io/2022/05/21/Project-1.html), I looked at COVID-19 data provided by The New York Times. If you haven't read it, I highly recommend reading it before continuing any further.

For my last question of that post, I asked, 'What are the top 10 states by deaths:population ratio and is their governor a Democrat or Republican?' and the results were surprising. Here were the results:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105367716/170274486-64b0e227-ec20-4c59-99ad-1b6e2d3df5c7.png)

As seen above, 9 out of the top 10 states by death:population ratio were Democrat governed sates. 

This was surprising due to how Republicans have questionably handled the pandemic since it began including the promotion of misinformation [[1]](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-misinformation.html)[[2]](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/11/trumps-lies-about-coronavirus/608647/)[[3]](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/gop-state-lawmakers-spread-covid-19-misinformation-76166298)[[4]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/09/14/florida-desantis-vaccine-misinformation-rna/), purposeful ignorance of health and medical professionals [[5]](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03035-4)[[6]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/coronavirus-ravaged-florida-as-ron-desantis-sidelined-scientists-and-followed-trump/2020/07/25/0b8008da-c648-11ea-b037-f9711f89ee46_story.html), disregard for and sometimes outright banning public health measures [[7]](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/06/texas-greg-abbott-covid-restrictions/)[[8]](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgia-governor-brian-kemp-bans-city-face-mask-orders-coronavirus-pandemic/)[[9]](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/appeals-court-rules-favor-florida-governor-reinstates-ban-mask-mandates-florida-2021-09-10/), and the prioritizement of the economy over peoples wellbeing [[10]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886921002658). So this leaves one to ask, if who's in charge doesn't affect a state's deaths:population ratio, what might?

## After some thought as to what might factors might signifanctly affect the deaths:population ratio, I've decided to ask these questions:
1. Does a state's population density correlate with its deaths:population ratio?
2. Does a state's income inequality correlate with its deaths:population ratio?
3. Does a state's education level correlate with its deaths:population ratio?
4. Do the aforementioned indepedent variables combined correlate with a state's death:population ratio?
5. Overall what are my thoughts?

In order to answer the questions above, I collected each state's death:population ratio, population density (population/sq. km.), income inequality [(Gini coefficient)](https://data.oecd.org/inequality/income-inequality.htm) and educational attainment level rates. 

Here is the SQL query I used to collect each states death:population ratio from the 'covid19NYT' database used in Project #1:
```
SELECT  state_info.state,
        MAX(deaths) AS total_deaths,
        population AS est_population_2021,
        (MAX(deaths) * 1.0 / population) AS deaths_population_ratio,
        governor,
        political_party
FROM state_info
INNER JOIN us_counties_2022
ON state_info.state = us_counties_2022.state
GROUP BY state_info.state
ORDER BY state;
```

[Here is a link to the file containing all the aforementioned data - state_info2.xlsx](https://github.com/robertjspencer/robertjspencer.github.io/files/8920916/state_info2.xlsx). This file also contains all of my workings.


##### The population data was [retrieved from the United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2020s-state-total.html#par_textimage). The population data used was the 2021 population estimate. 
##### The area data was [retrieved from the United States Census Bereau](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/2010/geo/state-area.html). The area data used was Land Sq. Km. 
##### The Gini coefficient data was [retrieved from the United States Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=Gini&g=0100000US_0400000US01,02,04,05,06,08,09,10,11,12,13,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,53,54,55,56,72&tid=ACSDT1Y2019.B19083&moe=false&tp=true).
##### The educational attainment level data was [retrieved from the United States Census Bureau](https://web.archive.org/web/20210427151001if_/https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=educational%20attainment&g=0100000US,.04000.001_0400000US72&tid=ACSST1Y2019.S1501&tp=true&hidePreview=true).


### Question 1 answer - Does a state's population density(X1) correlate with its deaths:population ratio(Y)?

Using state_info2.csv, I calculated the relationship between each state's deaths:population ratio and population density:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105367716/174106258-1ab84caf-b8b7-4452-9f0b-b3669b4be8e8.png)

The resulting R-value = 0.24. Meaning that there is a weak positive correlation between a state's death:population ratio and population density. 
P-value = 0.1, as such I am 90% confident about my result.

### Question 2 answer - Does a state's income inequality (X2) correlate with its deaths:population ratio(Y)?

Using state_info2.csv, I calculated the relationship between each state's death:population ratio and income inequality:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105367716/174106379-6b52a450-cabe-4446-aee7-295d2cf7d664.png)

The resulting R-value = 0.17. Meaning that there is a weak positive correlation between a state's death:population ratio and income inequality.
P-value = 0.25, as such I am 75% confident about my result. 

### Question 3 answer - Does a state's education level (X3,X4,X5) correlate with its deaths:population ratio(Y)?

Using state_info2.csv, I calculated the relationship between each state's death:population ratio and education level:

*High school diploma or higher(X3):*
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105367716/174106507-bed54504-12e3-4c2a-a966-068d3afc472b.png)

The resulting R-value = -0.23. Meaning that there is a weak inverse correlation between a state's educational attainment being 'High school diploma or higher' and death:population ratio.
P-value = 0.11, as such I am 89% confident about my result.

*Bachelor's degree or higher(X4):*
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105367716/174106641-55f64a0c-4aa8-4808-aa59-c78979f821b4.png)

The resulting R-value = 0.0025. Meaning that there is a negligible positive correlation between a state's educational attainment being 'Bachelor's degree or higher' and death:population ratio.
P-value = 0.99, as such I am 1% confident about my result.

*Advanced degree^(X5):*
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105367716/174106723-10c777e9-fdd3-48f9-9fa8-2a7bcb6a9a4c.png)
^Advanced e.g. PgCert, PgDip, Hons, Masters, PhD

The resulting R-value = 0.07. Meaning that there is a negligible positive correlation between a state's educational attainment being 'Bachelor's degree or higher' and death:population ratio.
P-value = 0.62, as such I am 38% confident about my result.

### Question 4 answer - Can any of the aforementioned independent variables together, which are appropriate, significantly explain a state's death:population ratio?

To answer this question I first used excel to run a simple linear regression between the independent variables I've decided to use, X1 and X3. I've excluded the rest either due to a weak correlation or low confidence level. I've decided to include X1 and X3 supporting that their confidence levels are high enough given the low number of observations involved and what we're trying to examine.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105367716/174107744-60a2fe4d-c356-4de7-b9d0-a71f614b7f2a.png)

R-value = ±0.08. Meaning that there is a negligible correlation between X1 and X3 and it's safe to say multicollinearity likely isn't an issue.

Now after having checked for severe multicollinearity, here is the multiple linear regression I ran between Y, X1 and X3:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105367716/174107976-19db4733-733c-4ec4-94f8-7a8e97f2c057.png)

R-value = ±0.31. This is a weak correlation. Adjusted R-squared = 0.06, meaning that 6% of the variance of Y is explained by X1 and X3. P-value (*Significance F*) = 0.09, as such I am 91% confident about my result.

### Question 5 answer - What are my thoughts?

Quite frankly, I'm quite surprised. Going further into this project, I would've thought these independent variables would've significantly further explained a state's death:population ratio in regards to COVID-19 than they apparently do.

So what might better explain the death:population ratio  instead? 
Well there's 2 further things I would look at. 
First the [social determinants of health](https://www.who.int/health-topics/social-determinants-of-health#tab=tab_1) and what I haven't touched upon, specifically:

- Unemployment and job insecurity
- Working life conditions
- Food insecurity
- Housing, basic amenities and the environment
- Early childhood development
- Social inclusion and non-discrimination
- Structural conflict
- Access to affordable health services of decent quality

Secondly it might instead be better to look at it on a more localized level, perhaps by county death:population ratio, instead of on a state level. Some states are practically countries in their own rights, both economically and in terms of land mass. As such, breaking it down by county might be the more appropriate approach.

However I think this is where I'll leave this project for the foreseeable future given: the amount of spare time I currently have, I am wanting to do other projects and that looking at these 2 further things would be a rather big task.

Overall I found this project very interesting and I hope you as the reader has too.

Cheers, Robert.
