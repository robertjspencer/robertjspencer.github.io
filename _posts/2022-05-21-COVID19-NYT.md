## SQL Project #1. Analyzing COVID-19 data in the United States

For my first personal project using SQL I've decided to look at publicly available COVID-19 data.

[Here](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) is a link to the public dataset I've used, provided by The New York Times.

I'm most interested in the us-counties-2022.csv file seen below, which contains the columns: date, state, fips, and cases and deaths this year (2022).

From this data I plan on answering these questions:
** What are the top 10 counties by cases?
** What are the top 10 states by cases?
** Which 10 counties have the least cases?
** Which 10 states have the least cases?

Before I import this file to PostgreSQL I need to create a table to accomodate the import.
