## SQL Project #1. Analyzing 2022 COVID-19 data in the United States

For my first personal project using SQL I've decided to look at publicly available COVID-19 data.

[Here](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) is a link to the public dataset I've used, provided by The New York Times.

I'm most interested in the us-counties-2022.csv file seen below, which contains the columns: date, state, fips (FIPS), cases and deaths so far this year. As a New Zealander I've never heard of 'FIPS' and its use has been [deemed obsolete by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2008-09-02/pdf/E8-20306.pdf). So I've decided to exclude the column.

From this data I plan on answering these simple questions for my first project:

    1. What are the top 10 counties by cases?
    2. What are the top 10 states by cases?
    3. Which 10 counties have the least cases?
    4. Which 10 states have the least cases?

To accomodate for us-counties-2022.csv in PostgreSQL, I've created the table us_countries_2022 using the query below. I ommitted using constraints as I'm both unfamiliar with this table and unable to see the need for them.
```
CREATE TABLE us_counties_2022(
    date DATE,
    county VARCHAR(50),
    state VARCHAR(50),
    cases INTEGER,
    deaths INTEGER
)
```
