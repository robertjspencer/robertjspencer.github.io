## SQL Project #1. Analyzing COVID-19 data in the United States

For my first personal project using SQL I've decided to look at publicly available COVID-19 data.

[Here](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) is a link to the public dataset I've used, provided by The New York Times.

I'm most interested in the us-counties-2022.csv file seen below, which contains the columns: date, state, fips, cases and deaths.

Before I import this file to PostgreSQL I need to create a table to accomodate the import.
