## SQL Project #1. Analyzing COVID-19 data in the United States

For my first personal project using SQL I've decided to look at publicly available COVID-19 data.

[Here](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) is a link to the public dataset I've used, provided by The New York Times.

I'm most interested in the us-counties-2022.csv file seen below, which contains the columns: date, state, fips, and cases and deaths this year (2022).

From this data I plan on answering these questions:

* What are the top 10 counties by cases?
* What are the top 10 states by cases?
* Which 10 counties have the least cases?
* Which 10 states have the least cases?

To accomodate for us-counties-2022.csv in PostgreSQL, I've created the table us_countries_2022 using the query below. I ommitted using constraints as I'm unfamiliar with this table.
```
CREATE TABLE us_counties_2022(
    date DATE,
    county VARCHAR(50),
    state VARCHAR(50),
    fips INTEGER,
    cases INTEGER,
    deaths INTEGER
)
```
