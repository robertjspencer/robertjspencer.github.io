Today I completed the course [The Complete SQL Bootcamp 2022: Go from Zero to Hero](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-sql-bootcamp/) on Udemy by Jose Portilla. From this course I've learnt how to: run queries; use joins; restore and create databases; alter, create and drop both tables and columns; execute conditional expressions and procedures; and both import and export data to and from PostgreSQL which was the system used for this course - to highlight some of the things I've learnt.

Overall I really enjoyed this course and found Jose to be an excellent instructor.
