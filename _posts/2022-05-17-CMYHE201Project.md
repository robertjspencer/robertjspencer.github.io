## University of Waikato Course CMYHE201 - 'Healthy Lifestyles and Healthy Communities' - Health Promotion Campaign Project

For [CMYHE201 - 'Healthy Lifestyles and Healthy Communities'](https://papers.waikato.ac.nz/papers/2021/CMYHE201), which I took B trimester 2021, we had to group with a partner and design and create a health promotion campaign. 

My partner, Precious Brown, and I's chosen health promotion campaign topic was Asian elderly's high suicide rates here in Aotearoa.
