## 'The Complete SQL Bootcamp 2022: Go from Zero to Hero' Completed

Today I completed the course [The Complete SQL Bootcamp 2022: Go from Zero to Hero](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-sql-bootcamp/) on Udemy by Jose Portilla. 

From this course I've learnt how to: run queries; use joins; restore and create databases; alter, create and drop both tables and columns; execute conditional expressions and procedures; and both import and export data to and from Postgresql which was the system used for this course - to highlight some of the things I've learnt.

Overall I really enjoyed this course and found Jose to be an excellent instructor. My next step from here is to take the skills I've learnt from this course and to apply it in some personal projects, analyzing publicly available datasets.
