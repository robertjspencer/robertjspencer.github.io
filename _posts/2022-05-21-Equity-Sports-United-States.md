## SQL Project #1. Equity in Athletics Across the United States

For my first personal project using SQL I've decided to look at data relating to equity in athletics across the United States, intersecting my two majors nicely as a result; Unfortunately I couldn't find any raw data regarding equity in athletics here in New Zealand, so I settled on the United States instead. 

[Here](https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/#/) is a link to the public dataset I've used, provided by the U.S. Department of Education.

#### To download the data yourself first click on 'Download Data'

#### Next you'll want to scroll down the page a little bit and click on 'All data combined for academic year 2020-21'
