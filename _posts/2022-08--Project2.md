# Project #2. July 2022 FIDE Chess Rankings

Towards the start of this year I've begun to play chess. Whilst I'm no good at it, often losing due to my own mistakes, I've became quite passionate about the game and its intricacies. I'll often find myself watching videos of chess grandmasters and thinking to myself "how on earth did they do that?". In turn whilst thinking of what to do for my next project, I've figured that chess would make for a good topic to analyse, and so for this project I'll be analysing the top 200 FIDE Chess Rankings for July 2022. [*Here*](https://github.com/robertjspencer/robertjspencer.github.io/files/9365533/Chess.FIDE.Rankings.csv) is a static link to the data set I will be using.

For this project I'll be making a dashboard in Tableau visualising the data, and R (programming language) to correlate country (x1), # of international games played (x2), birth year (x3) and Elo (y).
