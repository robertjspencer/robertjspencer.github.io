# Project #2. July 2022 FIDE Chess Rankings

For this project I'll be making a dashboard in Tableau to visualise the top 200 July 2022 FIDE chess rankings, and R (programming language) to plot:

* Elo versus number of international games played


Towards the start of this year I've begun to play chess. Whilst I'm no good at it, often losing due to my own mistakes, I've became quite passionate about the game and its intricacies. I'll often find myself watching videos of chess grandmasters and thinking to myself "how on earth did they do that?". In turn whilst thinking of what to do for my next project, I've figured that chess would make for a good topic to analyse, and so for this project I'll be analysing the top 200 FIDE Chess Rankings for July 2022. [*Here*](https://github.com/robertjspencer/robertjspencer.github.io/files/9365533/Chess.FIDE.Rankings.csv) is a static link to the data set I will be using.

### Tableau Dashboard

### R Plots

First lets load the packages I wish to use:

```
install.packages('tidyverse')
library(tidyverse)
```

Then lets load the data set:

```
FIDEChessRankings <- read_csv("Chess FIDE rankings")
```

At a glance this data set looks nearly perfect, however lets drop the 'title' column as every player is a grandmaster (GM) and lets change ELO to Elo and games to games_played.
