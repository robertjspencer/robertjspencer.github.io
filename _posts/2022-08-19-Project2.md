# Project #2. July 2022 FIDE Chess Rankings

For this project I'll be making a simple dashboard in Tableau to visualise the top 200 July 2022 FIDE chess rankings, and R (programming language) to plot:

* Elo versus number of international games played
* Elo versus age

Why? Well towards the start of this year I've begun to play chess. Whilst I'm no good at it, often losing due to my own mistakes, I've became quite passionate about the game and its intricacies. I'll often find myself watching videos of chess grandmasters and thinking to myself "how on earth did they do that?". In turn whilst thinking of what to do for my next project, I figured that chess would make for a good topic to analyse, and so for this project I'll be analysing the top 200 FIDE Chess Rankings for July 2022. [*Here*](https://github.com/robertjspencer/robertjspencer.github.io/files/9365533/Chess.FIDE.Rankings.csv) is a static link to the data set I will be using.

### Tableau Dashboard

### R Plots

First lets load the packages I wish to use:

```
install.packages('tidyverse')
library(tidyverse)
```

Then lets load the data set:

```
FIDEChessRankings <- read_csv("Chess FIDE rankings")
```

At a glance this data set looks nearly perfect. However it could use a tad more cleaning. Lets change birth_year to age to simplify things, rename ELO to Elo and games to games_played for clarification, and drop the columns title as every player is a grandmaster (GM) and birth year as it's now redundant. Note: ones chess Elo rating relates to their performance competitively. 

```
# renaming columns
a1 <- FIDEChessRankings %>%
  rename(
    Elo=ELO,
    games_played=games
  )

# converting birth_year to age
a1$age <- 2022 - a1$birth_year

# dropping title and birth_year column
a2 <- select(a1,-c(title,birth_year))
```
Here's what the data looks like now:

### Great! Now time for our first plot: Elo versus number of games played:

```
# First I calculated the correlation using the code immediately below resulting in a r value = 0.3902296 to decide the degree of relationship
cor(a2$games_played,a2$Elo)

# Now I can plot the graph itself
ggplot(data=a2)+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=games_played,y=Elo))+
  labs(x="Games Played",
       title="Does Playing Competitively More Often Result In a Higher Elo?",
       subtitle="Plot of Elo by Games Played",
       caption="There is a low positive relationship between the two variables")+
  geom_smooth(data=a2, formula=y~x,method=lm,aes(x = games_played, y = Elo,group=1),se=FALSE)
  ```

Beautiful! Looks like playing more games moderately improves Elo for the top chess players.

### Now for our second plot: Elo vs age:

```
# Calculating the r value between the two variables = -0.07885134
cor(a2$age,a2$Elo)

# Followed by the graph
ggplot(data=a2)+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=age,y=Elo))+
  labs(x="Age",
       title="Does a Players Age Year Affect Their Elo?",
       subtitle="Plot of Elo by Age",
       caption="The plot shows a slight negative correlation between age and Elo")+
  geom_smooth(data=a2, formula=y~x,method=lm,aes(x = age, y = Elo,group=1),se=FALSE)
```


![file_show](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105367716/185747463-19678ade-d4b1-4849-a00f-7f3d5cc51a3a.png)

Voila! Based off this plot, performance amongst top players marginally drops as they age. 

Overall this has been a fun quick project. [*Here*](https://github.com/robertjspencer/robertjspencer.github.io/files/9386847/Project2Workings.txt) is a .txt file with my workings in R if you're interested. Thanks for reading!
