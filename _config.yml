title: "Robert Spencer SQL & Analytics Related Portfolio"
author: "Robert J Spencer"
#description: "This portfolio is a collection of my own SQL projects and anything related to analytics including appropriate university coursework. 
On the 7th of May roughly I decided I wanted to persue a career in health analytics, after doing a qualitative analysis of Long COVID facebook posts for one of my university courses, CMYHE302 - 'Health in the Digital Era', which sparked my interest.
This portfolio aims to show that I am indeed capable of analytical thinking, proficient in the basics of SQL, and am capable of working in a team."
