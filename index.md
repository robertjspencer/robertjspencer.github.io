# Introduction

Analytics portfolio which I work on in my free time when I'm not at the gym or blundering a game of chess.

Skills:
- Data Analysis
- SQL
- Excel, Google Sheets
- Tableau
- Python
- R

NOTE: I am currently not updating this portfolio at the moment as I'm currently doing 161250 'Data Analytics' at Massey University (MU) instead of personal projects. Come February 2023 I will most likely be doing MU's Master of Analytics as well.
