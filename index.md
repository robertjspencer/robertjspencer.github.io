## A bit about me

I work as a Community Health Services Administrator at St John New Zealand. I'm also in my final year as a student at The University of Waikato double majoring in both community health and human performance science, set to graduate this upcoming October.

I chose to study community health because my mother is Filipino, and after seeing and experiencing the significant inequity occuring in the Philippines first-hand, I settled on community health to help equip me with the knowledge to combat such inequity; I also have a significant interest in sports, specifically Olympic Weightlifting and Powerlifting, both in which I've competed and coached. This as a result has influenced me to study human performance science to better understand the sports I love.
