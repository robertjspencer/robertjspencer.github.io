This portfolio is a collection of my own SQL projects and anything related to analytics including appropriate university coursework. 

On roughly the 7th of May 2022 I decided I wanted to pursue a career in health analytics, after doing a qualitative analysis of Long COVID Facebook posts for one of my university courses, CMYHE302 - 'Health in the Digital Era', sparking my interest in the field.

I have no formal experience as an analyst. So the aim of this portfolio is to show that I am indeed capable of analytical thinking, proficient in the basics of SQL, and am capable of working in a team in the hopes of landing an analyst job.
