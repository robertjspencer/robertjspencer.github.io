This portfolio is a collection of my own SQL projects and anything related to analytics including appropriate university coursework. 

On the 7th of May roughly I decided I wanted to pursue a career in health analytics, after doing a qualitative analysis of Long COVID Facebook posts for one of my university courses, CMYHE302 - 'Health in the Digital Era', which sparked my interest.

This portfolio aims to show that I am indeed capable of analytical thinking, proficient in the basics of SQL, and am capable of working in a team.
