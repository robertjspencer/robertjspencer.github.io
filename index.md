# Introduction

On the 7th of May 2022 I decided I wanted to pursue a career in health analytics, after starting a qualitative analysis project of Long COVID Facebook posts for one of my university courses, [CMYHE302 - 'Health in the Digital Era'](https://papers.waikato.ac.nz/papers/2022/CMYHE302), sparking my interest in the field.

I have no formal experience as an analyst. So the aim of this portfolio is to show that I am capable of analytical and critical thinking, learning and using the technical skills required, and working in a team in the hopes of landing an analyst job.

## A bit about me

I'm in my third and final year as a student at The University of Waikato double majoring in both community health and human performance science, set to graduate this upcoming November. I also work part time as a Community Health Services Administrator at St John New Zealand.

I chose to study community health because my mother is Filipino, and after seeing and experiencing the significant inequity occuring in the Philippines first-hand, I settled on community health to help equip me with the knowledge to combat such inequity; I also have a significant interest in sports, specifically Olympic Weightlifting and Powerlifting, both in which I've competed and coached. This as a result has influenced me to study human performance science to better understand the sports I love.
